Since I run two serial shell scripts, I have measured the computation time for each script and combined the time.

For run_Rp2.sh,

each of jobs for generating frequency tables took different computation. Thus, I took the worst case that tooks longest computation time, which is 4m47s

For run_Rp3,sh, which combines freqeuncy tables and measure statistics, it took 1.260s (Real time)

Thus, total computation time is 4m48s.

As expected, since significant time was spent for reading files and splitting lines, we are able to reduce remarkably the computational time overall by parallelizing the file processing.
